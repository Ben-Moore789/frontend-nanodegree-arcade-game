Epic Frogger Game
===============================
Arrow keys move the player ship

You have 3 lives, don't hit any enemy ships!

Picking up shields protects the player ship from the enemy ships.

Every time the player gets to the other side and subsequently returns, 
the enemies get faster and more are added slowly.  

Another shield is added to the map as well when the player returns.

Shields can be stacked.
